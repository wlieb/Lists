# Branched Block List Project

This repository is a branch of the Block List Project lists for PiHole.  Please visit them for the full original Block List.

[Block List Project (https://github.com/blocklistproject)](https://github.com/blocklistproject)

Items contained in the lists in this fork are added and removed to suit me and my family's personal convenience and needs and may not necessarily be "best practice" with the security / privacy community.  Some trackers are allowed to ease multi-user use within a family where strict blocking breaks certain activities and features used by non-tech saavy users.

All changes are documented when committed.

# Details:
These lists were created because the founder of the project wanted something with a little more control over what is being blocked. Many lists are all or nothing. We set out to create lists with more control over what is being blocked.
&nbsp;
## Versions:
We have recently created an alternative version (Alt-Version) of our lists. 
<p>Original Version:</p>
<p>&nbsp;All urls in the version of the list are listed in the host file as follows</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;0.0.0.0 example.com</p>
<p>Alternative Version:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;All urls in this version of the list are listed in the host file as follows</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;example.com</p>

Our users brought it to our attention that some devices error out if the url is preceded by an IP address. 

&nbsp;

# Usage:
These converted files can be used with various DNS and domain-blocking tools:
